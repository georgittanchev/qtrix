The backup folder contains a backup of the whole cPanel account. The current backups in the /backup directory are as follows:

[backup_dirs]

Due to the way that incremental backups work, they're linked to each other and deleting a backup might not have any effect on the disk usage. You can read more about incremental-type backups on the page below:

> https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/backup/backup-configuration/

The current backup configuration is as follows:

[backup_conf]

BACKUPACCTS and BACKUPSUSPENDEDACCTS indicate if the cPanel accounts (suspended or not) will be backed up. Daily/monthly/weekly backups "yes" indicate that they are enabled and "no" that they are disabled, the retention under each type indicates how many backups are kept of the named type.

We can offer to reconfigure the backing up service to ONLY retain weekly, daily OR monthly backups and to reconfigure the retention to 1.
